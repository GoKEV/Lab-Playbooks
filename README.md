# Ansible Playbooks

This is my repo for lots of small and barely-tested Ansible playbooks for use in labs and demos.  Please keep this in mind when borrowing / reusing pieces of this.  It should generally be functional, but YMMV.  I hope this provides you a baseline of ideas to stimulate into further automation.
